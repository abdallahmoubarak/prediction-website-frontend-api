# prediction-website-frontend-api

### Assignment

You are asked to implement a full functional website: Prediction Website<br/>
The website aims to predict the gender, age and the nationality of a given name.<br/>
Everytime the website is loaded, it should show a random dog image.<br/>
The user has to input his/her name on the website and click on a button
Once button clicked, you’re going to fetch three apis (one to get the predicted gender, one for the age, and one to get the predicted nationality - you might get two nationalities with different probabilities - show them both)
Design the website the way you want but you should make it responsive and “cute”.<br/>
The whole project should be one page based.<br/>
You are not allowed to use axios. You have to use the fetch() function.<br/>
The api for getting the gender is: https://api.genderize.io?name=rio<br/>
The api for getting the age is: https://api.agify.io/?name=nour<br/>
The api for getting the nationality: https://api.nationalize.io/?name=mohamad<br/>
The api for getting the dog images: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random<br/>
Deadline: 10 Sept 2022 Sunday 10:00 AM.<br/>
Deliverable: GitHub Repo Link (You have to create a branch and keep on pushing to it, before submitting you have to merge to the main branch)<br/>
